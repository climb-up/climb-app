# ClimbUp 🧗‍♂️
A dedicated app for rock climbing enthusiasts that provides detailed topos—interactive maps of climbing rocks and routes. Users can explore nearby climbing spots, view route details, and download topos for offline use, ensuring full access even in remote areas with no internet connection.

## Application is still in development. We are actively working on building the topo database and refining core features to support climbers in the field 👷🏻‍♂️
